//Write C / C++ program to store marks scored for first test of subject 'Data Structures and Algorithms' for N students.Compute
//I.The average score of class
//II.Highest scoreand lowest score of class
//III.Marks scored by most of the students
//IV.list of students who were absent for the test
//Step-1: Define class arr(array was not allowed here)
//Step2: Data members size and a[1000]
//Step 3:create main() in which we have object of class and input n and then  call input() and output() fns
//Step 4: ask the user for no of students present for test. so, abs=n-a.size;
//Step 5: go for max fn.
//Step 6: go for min fn.
//Step 7: go for avrg fn. In it, take sum as a float and divide by n(total students). NOT size(present students).
//Step6: go for freq fn. 
//Freq fn
// have 2 for loops . initialise count & temp_count. have a temp .
//compare in 2 loops and check after inner loop is done everytime.
